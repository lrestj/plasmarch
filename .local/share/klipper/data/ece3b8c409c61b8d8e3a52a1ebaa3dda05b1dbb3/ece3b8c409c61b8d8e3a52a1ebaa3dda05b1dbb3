    # Add Scheme/Mount URI:
    #   -> Available schemes: mtp, gphoto2, smb, sftp, ftp, nfs, dns-sd, dav, davs, dav+sd, davs+sd, afp, afc, sshfs
    #   -> Read more about the schemes here: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects(2f)gvfs(2f)schemes.html
    #   -> Explain about the scheme:
    #       -> If it shows like this: {ftp,ftps,ftpis}://[user@]host[:port]
    #       -> All of the value within [] is optional. For values within {}, you must choose exactly one. All others are required.
    #       -> Example: {ftp,ftps,ftpis}://[user@]host[:port] => ip and port: "ftp://myusername@192.168.1.2:9999" or domain: "ftps://myusername@github.com"
    #       -> More examples: smb://user@192.168.1.2/share, smb://WORKGROUP;user@192.168.1.2/share, sftp://user@192.168.1.2/, ftp://192.168.1.2/
    # !WARNING: - Scheme/Mount URI shouldn't contain password.
    #           - Google Drive, One drive are listed automatically via GNOME Online Accounts (GOA). Avoid adding them.
    #           - MTP, GPhoto2, AFC, Hard disk/drive, fstab with x-gvfs-show are also listed automatically. Avoid adding them.
    #           - SSH, SFTP, FTP(s), AFC, DNS_SD now support [/share]. For example: sftp://user@192.168.1.2/home/user_name -> /share = /home/user_name
    #           - ssh:// is alias for sftp://.
    #             -> {sftp,ssh}://[user@]host[:port]. Host can be Host alias in .ssh/config file, ip or domain.
    #             -> For example (home is Host alias in .ssh/config file: Host home):
    #                  -> ssh://user_name@home/home/user_name -> this will mount root path, but jump to subfolder /home/user_name
    #                  -> sftp://user_name@192.168.1.2/home/user_name -> same as above but with ip
    #                  -> sftp://user_name@192.168.1.2:9999/home/user_name -> same as above but with ip and port
